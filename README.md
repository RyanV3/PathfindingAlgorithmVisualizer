# PathfindingAlgorithmVisualizer

Project based on Clement Mihailescu's Pathfinding Visualizer Tutorial.

I thought the concept was very interesting and visually stunning, so I wanted to create it for myself. 
I also want to add on a bit more functionality by improving the overall look of the page and adding 
several other pathfinding algorithms to visualize. This project has been a very fun way to learn React.


Run the command,

npm start

in the project directory to run the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it 
in the browser.
