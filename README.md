# PathfindingAlgorithmVisualizer

Project based on Clement Mihailescu's Pathfinding Visualizer Tutorial.

I thought the concept was very interesting and visually stunning, so I wanted to create it for myself. 
I also want to add on a bit more functionality by improving the overall look of the page and adding 
several other pathfinding algorithms to visualize. This project has been a very fun way to learn React.
